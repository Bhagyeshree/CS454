### Extra Credit - Due 3/21/15 at 11:59pm


Write unit tests for each fucntion inside the extra-credit/app.js file. Total of 15 points. Up to 3pts per succesfully  tested functions.


#### TESTS
Each fucntion should have a practical and useful test. 

 1.  look at http://chaijs.com/api/bdd/ for chai.expect API
 2.  test for property keys or deep property keys
 3.  test for instanceof or type Object/Array/Number/String/etc
 4.  test to ensure a file was written.
 5.  create only fixtures that are needed.  give the fixtures meaningful names.

**No points for failing tests.** <br>
**No points if assertions (expect statements) are not made.** <br>
**No points if an assertion is made that is unrelated to the function being tested.**

#### HINTS

 1.  read app.js and then run application
 2.  try adding console.log() to functions to see expected results
 3.  review examples from Week 9 and Week 10
