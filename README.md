**Course Description:** <br/>
This course will cover Node.js for the server-side and AngularJS for the front-end user interface. It will begin with a discussion on the fundamentals, including syntax, closures, eventloop, callbacks and scope. Then the class will jump right into teaching the Node.js platform through handling HTTP methods GET, POST, PUT and DELETE to execute operations, utilizing open-source modules and covering the Angular MVVM framework.  The course will have several homework assignments which will culminate in a project where students will build a RESTful web service application using Node.js which interacts with an API and returns JSON information to the Angular front-end.
