###Midterm - 2/14/15

Teams will create a presentation on a node module listed on npm - https://www.npmjs.com/.


Each team member will present for 2-3 minutes. The presentation should cover topics like:

 - What problem does your node module solve?
 
 - Are there any other competitors to your node module?
   - If so, what are they?
   - How does the competitive module differ?

 - What kind of documentation is available for your module?
 
 - Any additional details I should know about your module?

**Teams should keep in mind as they research their module, that the Final Presentation will need to include unique code examples from each team member.**
